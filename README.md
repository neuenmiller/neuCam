# neuCam

Python programmed for Raspberry Pi for human tracking with IDing and tracking capability.

Due to limitations on the file sizes that can be hosted on GitHub, I are unable to provide the YOLO weight files out of the box. However, these can easily be downloaded and configured manually. I highly recommend getting the YOLO weights and configs from Darknet's YOLO page.

Recommended Models:

    High-end Hardware: yolov3-spp
    Medium-end Hardware: yolov3-416
    Budget Hardware: yolov3-tiny

After downloading your desired weight file, place it into the public/yolo directory to complete the setup.
